# DCKit #

### Summary ###

Our internal set of utilities and components that makes development faster and easier.

It is a collection of methods and extensions that replace the longer implementations you would otherwise need to use, including UIColor hex converters, UIView frame manipulations, adding/removing of child View controllers, a great range of NSDate extensions and more.

DCKit also includes:

* __DCRevealVC__: A controller for a vertical sliding drawer menu.

* __VC Custom Transitioning__: A set of custom view controller transitions.

DCKit is fully unit tested.

### Version ###

The master branch is written for Swift 2.2, with branches for Swift 2.3 and 3.0. 


### How do I get set up? ###

The suggested way to integrate DCKit to your project is using Cocoapods. It is not a public Cocoapod (please note that there is a public cocoapod with the same name), so please link to it in Your Podfile using:

`pod 'DCKit', :git => 'https://bitbucket.org/decodehq/dckit.git', :branch => 'maste`' 

for swift 2.2.

For swift 2.3 or 3.0, please target the following branches:

`:branch => 'swift-2.3â€™`
`:branch => 'swift-3.0'`

Alternatively, You can just clone the repository and drag` DCKit.xcodepr`oj into your project and link against the `DCKit.framework` in target dependencies, or just drag&drop individual `.swift` files into Your project.
